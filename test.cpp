/*
 * test.cpp
 *
 * This file will illustrate and test the usage of the midi library. When "make run" is
 * executed in the shell, this file will be called and the hexdump from the resulting midi
 * will be displayed. Then the midi file can be played by any media player supporting
 * midi.
 *
 * Since this library is a very low level library, the code used might get quite verbose.
 * For example, to add a note you will need to first add a note_on event to the track and
 * afterwards a note_off.
